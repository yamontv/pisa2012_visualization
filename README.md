## by Vyacheslav Yamont


## Dataset

This project explores The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 Dataset. PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

* The number of students who use programming is far less than those who doesn't use it
* Successful students in common are successful in all subjects simultaneously
* Wealth index has a very low impact on academic performance
* Male students have slightly higher math and science scores on average
* Female students have slightly higher reading scores on average
* The Number of computers has a high correlation with academic performance and wealth index
