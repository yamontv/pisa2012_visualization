# PISA 2012 Dataset Exploration
## by Vyacheslav Yamont


## Dataset

This project explores The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 Dataset. PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.
